# JPL Open-Source Rover Project
The JPL Open-Source Rover is a fully open-source scaled version of the 6 wheel rover design that JPL uses to explore the surface of mars. The robot is designed almost entirely out of consumer off the shelf (COTS) parts.

# Getting Started with the Software Build
The The [Software Steps pdf](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/ejunkins/osr/blob/master/Software/Software%20Steps.pdf) will walk you through all steps necessary to get the software up and running on the Raspberry Pi. This can be done at any point during the project up until all the electronics and mechanical parts are completed and you are ready to start controlling the robot from a Raspberry Pi. There is additionaly a [Software Controls pdf](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/ejunkins/osr/blob/master/Software/Software%20Controls.pdf) that can help you understand the mechanics of how the software calculates where all of the things necessary to drive coherently as a rover.
