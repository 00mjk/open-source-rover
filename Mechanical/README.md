# JPL Open-Source Rover Project
The JPL Open-Source Rover is a fully open-source scaled version of the 6 wheel rover design that JPL uses to explore the surface of mars. The robot is designed almost entirely out of consumer off the shelf (COTS) parts.

# Getting Started with the Mechanical build

## Folder organization

![Mechanical folder](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/ejunkins/osr/blob/master/Mechanical/images/mech%20folders.png)

This folder contains all of the documentation and information necessary for the mechanical build section of the project. It is broken down here into different subassemblies, with one Mechanical Integration of all of the assemblies. Each of these subassemblies has the parts list of that assembly, a document as to how to build that individual assembly, and a README that displays some of the information such as cost, estimated time to build, and its' mechanical mates to the rest of the robot. 

## Roadmap

![Mechanical roadmap](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/ejunkins/osr/blob/master/Mechanical/images/mech%20roadmap.png)

All individual subassemblies are meant to be completely parallelizeable in their build, so each individual piece can be built on its' own. Once all subassemblies are constructed there is one signal mechanical integration process where each of the pieces is taken and put together. This mechanical integration is meant only for the base assemblies released with the project, and might differ when using other modules/subassemblies.
